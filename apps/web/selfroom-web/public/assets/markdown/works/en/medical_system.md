### Details

I am helping EPOCH-NET, Inc. with a scheduling system for the medical field. I have joined the project from the middle of the project, and have only added some functions and modified some functions.

### Role

Backend

- At first, I was allowed to proceed with the project while learning about development methods.
- In reality, it was more like helping out by implementing some of the tasks assigned to me, such as standardizing error responses and improving the authentication process, and having the project leader conduct the testing, and then merging it into the production environment if it worked properly.

Frontend

- I rarely have a chance to touch the front end, but I help a little with the handling of error responses and other logic that depends on back-end protocols.
