#### Scope of activity backend〜
- Mainly on the backend
- My favorite language is c and I recently started writing rust!(I think I'm going to like this language(rust) the best.)
- Also, I just recently had a chance to touch docker and I'm into docker (I'm planning to publish this site using aws ecs)
- If I had to name one thing I'm good at, it would be code reading
- I am a fan of adopting the latest technology, but I dislike black boxes, so I customize my own frameworks by using code reading, which is my forte, and overriding them myself
- I usually study on udemy, books, qiita (mainly udemy)
- Also, we are basically looking to dabble in a wide range of areas
- I am currently working for [EPOCH-NET Inc.](https://www.epochworks.jp/) as a part-timer to gain practical experience!
- In website development, it is as follows(Completely **self-judgmental**.)
