<details class="card-details">
  <summary>PHP</summary>
  <div>

  - In the beginning, I wrote without using a framework, but now most of my projects' API servers are written using `laravel`.

  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>C</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I have no practical experience, as I have only used it for personal and competition programming.
  - In particular, the network programmers did their best, but there are no productions or other materials left!ðŸ¥²
  - I have learned a little about openGL (glut) in a university course and have created one simple game, but have not yet been able to do anything in depth.

<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Java</summary>
  <div>
  
  - This is the extent of what I have learned in university lectures.

  <summary>Python</summary>
  <div>
  
  - This is the extent of what I have learned in university lectures.

##### Other Technologies
***
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Docker</summary>
  <div>
  
  - We now use docker every time we develop two or more servers locally.
  - When I use docker, I usually use `docker compose` together.

  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Gitãƒ»GitHub</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I believe I have some knowledge and experience, but I have yet to experience the process of MERGE after meticulously testing the PR sent to me.
  - We also use `gitea` as well as github.
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>SQL</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I usually use postgres.
  - When I use laravel, nestJs, etc., I often use the `O/R mapper`, but when I test, I basically hit SQL directly, so I think I can do some basic syntax.
  - I understand transactions, etc., but I have never written directly in SQL, etc., and I usually only hit `DML (data manipulation)` when it comes to basic syntax.
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>HTMLãƒ»CSS</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I can do it because I also touch the front.

  <summary>OpenGLãƒ»WebGL</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I have only learned a little and have a vague understanding of the concept.

  - I have only touched the GLSL shader language a little.
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Shell</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I have not created any works, but I do write to improve my work efficiency.
  - I can use and write commands that I remember, but complex commands (`sed`, `awk`, etc.) are usually done by looking them up (~~I'd like to learn them better~~).
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Swagger</summary>
  <div>
  
  - When we do the backend on a project, we write `openapi.yaml`.
  - I have not studied it in detail, but I have no problem writing simple design documents.
  </div>
</details>

##### Languages, frameworks, and technologies you would like to use in the future
***
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>actix-web(rust)</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I've been working a lot on laravel projects, so I wanted to implement a backend in another language once in a while, and I wanted to use this super-fast framework...
  - I may change it to `rocket` or `axum` as I have a feeling that `rust` can be anything.
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>Tauri(Rust)</summary>
  <div>
  
  - I heard that you can make desktop apps using rust and react, etc., so I would like to try it anyway.
  </div>
</details>
<details class="card-details">
  <summary>lua</summary>
